# Seeing-Motion-in-the-Dark-pytorch
Unofficial pytorch code for Seeing-Motion in the Dark. This implementation is heavily borrowed from the offical Tensorflow code([here](https://github.com/cchen156/Seeing-Motion-in-the-Dark)), and inspired by another pytorch implementation([here](https://github.com/gmengusthk/Seeing-Motion-in-the-Dark-Pytorch)).

## Code

When training and testing on 512Ã—512 patches, our results is very close to that retrained on offical code.
### Train

  ```
  python train_patch512.py
  ```

### Test
 
  ```
  python test_patch512.py
  ```
